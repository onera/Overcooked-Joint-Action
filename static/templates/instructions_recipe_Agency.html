        Hello! In this task, you will be playing a
        cooking game. You will play one of two chefs
        in a restaurant that serves various soups.

        This is what one level of the game looks like:
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/training0_recipe.png" style="width:500px">
      <p>
        There are a number of objects in the game, labeled here:
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Movement and interactions</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/space-arrows.png" style="width:250px">
      <p>
        You can move up, down, left, and right using
        the <b>arrow keys</b>, and interact with objects
        using the <b>spacebar</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can interact with objects by facing them and pressing
        <b>spacebar</b>. Here are some examples:
      <ul>
        <li>You can pick up ingredients (onions or tomatoes) by facing
          the ingredient area and pressing <b>spacebar</b>.</li>
        <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing an empty counter,
          and press <b>spacebar</b>, you put the ingredient on the counter.</li>
        <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing a pot that is not full,
          and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will put the ingredient in the pot.</li>
        <li>If you are facing a pot that is non-empty, are currently holding nothing, and
          and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will begin cooking a soup.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Note that as you and your partner are moving around the kitchen
        you <u><b>cannot occupy the same location</b></u>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Cooking</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/soup.png" style="width:250px">
      <p>
        Once an ingredient is in the pot, you can begin cooking a soup by pressing
        <b>spacebar</b> as noted above. You can place up to 3 ingredients in a pot
        before cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a soup begins cooking, you'll notice a red number appear over the pot to
        denote the cook time. This number counts upward until the soup is done. Soup
        cook time is determined its ingredients; every onion adds {{ current_user.config["onion_time"]}} and
        every tomato adds {{ current_user.config["tomato_time"] }} to the cook time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Serving</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/serving-counter_recipe.png" style="width:800px">
      <p>
        Once the soup is in a bowl, you can serve it by bringing it to
        a grey serving counter.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Soups</h3>
      <p>
        There are 9 possible soup recipes that can be created from combinations of tomatoes
        and onions, each with its own icon. The recipe icons and the corresponding ingredients are
        listed below
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Your Goal</h3>
      <p>

        For each game, you will have a list of recipes to make.
        The goal of the game is to achieve all these recipes in the shortest possible time.

        Please note that you should complete the recipe list as quickly as possible, but in no specific sequence. 

        The <b>All Orders</b> list shows which recipes you have to realize for the game. 
        This is important because any soup served that is not on this list will not 
        be counted and will just waste your time. 


      </p>


      When a soup is served at the serving counter, it is automatically validated, and disapear from the 
      <b>All Orders</b> list of the recipes you have to realize during the game.

      <b>Your goal</b> is to make all the recipes in the "All Orders" list <b>AS FAST AS POSSIBLE</b>.

      <img class="center" src="static/images/info-panel_recipe.png" style="width:400px">
      

      <p> For exemple, here you have to make 3 soups:
        * tomato + tomato + tomato 
        * tomato + onion 
        * onion + onion + tomato 
      </p>

        During the experiment, you will interact with an agent who shares with you informations about its
        actions.
        It is really important for you now to understand which information the agent will provide you: 
        <p>
        1. Wich recipe the agent is performing
        </p>
        <p>
        2. What the agent is going to look for 
        </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Questions</h3>
      <br>
      <br>


      <h5 class="text-left">After each GAME</h5>
      <br>

      <p>
        At the end of each game, you will be asked a question:
        
      </p>

      <p>
        1) <b> "Did you feel in CONTROL during the game? " </b> : After each game, we will ask you to rate how well you felt in control during the game.
        Please note that it is very important to understand what "control" means here. The notion of control can be complex to define, but it is easier to understand with an example: 
        For example, in a driving situation, you feel more in control when you are in good visibility conditions, rather than in conditions where the weather obscures visibility, such as when it is raining or foggy. 
        So we'll ask you to rate how much control you felt over what you were doing during each game.    
        
      </p>
      <br>


        <p>
        2) <b> "How much do you feel RESPONSIBLE to have caused this result? " </b> : Your goal is to complete the 
        requested recipes as quickly as possible. Once the game is complete, you will see how long it takes 
        you to complete the game. Then, you will need to determine who how much you feel responsible to have caused this result.
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h5 class="text-left">After each BLOCK of games</h5>
      <br>

      At the end of each assignment block, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about the 
      games you have just completed.

      <br>
      <br>

        <h4 class="text-center">It is VERY IMPORTANT to answer the questions SERIOUSLY for the experiment to be valid.</h4>

      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Course of the experiment </h3>
      <p>

        <p>You will start by performing a tutorial to familiarize yourself with the interface.</p>
      
        <p>Then you will have a training blocks (containing 4 games) to learn how to play with the agent. </p>
      
        <p>Then you will start the experience where you will complete 4 blocks containing 4 games each.</p>
      
        <p>You will be able to take a small break between each block if you wish. </p>

      </p>

      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE STARTING THE EXPERIMENT</h3>
      <p>

        <p> It is possible that, for some reason, you have the impression that the page is loading incorrectly.
          If you detect such behavior from the web page, please do these things:</p>

          <p>
            2. REPORT the problem at the end of the experiment during the final questionnaire.
          </p> 
          <p>
            3. CONTACT the experimenter through the Prolific platform.
